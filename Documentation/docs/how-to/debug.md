# How to Debug

When working with the HiveMQtt client, there may be instances where deeper insight into the internal workings of the client is necessary to troubleshoot or understand its behavior. One of the most effective ways to gain this insight is through TRACE level logging.

# Understanding TRACE Level Logging

TRACE level logging is the most detailed form of logging, providing comprehensive information about the events happening within the HiveMQtt client. Enabling TRACE logging allows you to see a fine-grained view of the client's operations, which can be invaluable for debugging complex issues.

See [How to Configure Logging](/docs/how-to/configure-logging) for the specifics on how to enable TRACE logging.
